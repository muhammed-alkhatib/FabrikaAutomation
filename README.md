# Fabrika Automation and Stock Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a **Factory Automation and Stock Management System** developed as part of the **NTP course**.  
The system aims to digitize factory operations such as product management, stock tracking, and database-driven automation using a structured and modular software architecture.

---

## Purpose and Scope
The main purpose of this project is to develop a desktop-based automation system that enables factories to manage products, stock levels, and related operations efficiently.

The scope of the project includes:
- Product and stock management
- Database-based data storage
- User-friendly graphical interface
- Modular and scalable system design

---

## Project Planning
A **Gantt chart** was created during the planning phase to organize and schedule project tasks, including analysis, design, development, testing, and documentation.

---

## System Analysis
Previous similar projects were analyzed, and their limitations were identified.  
Unlike earlier systems that relied heavily on manual processes, this project introduces:
- Automated stock control
- Structured database relationships
- Improved user interface design

---

## System Design

### Architecture
The system follows a layered architecture:
- Presentation Layer (User Interface)
- Business Logic Layer
- Database Layer

The infrastructure is designed to support future enhancements such as:
- Artificial intelligence integration
- API-based external system integration

### Database Design
The database consists of structured tables such as:
- Products
- Stock
- Categories
- Users

Primary and foreign key relationships are used to ensure data integrity.

### Development Methodology
The **Waterfall Model** was used due to the clearly defined requirements and the academic nature of the project.

### Modules
- User Interface Module
- CRUD Operations Module
- Database Management Module
- AI-ready Infrastructure Module (future use)

### UML Diagrams
The following UML diagrams were prepared:
- Use Case Diagram
- Class Diagram
- Sequence Diagram

---

## Common Subsystems

### Security
- User authentication
- Authorization control

### Data Backup
- Data is stored securely in SQL Server
- Manual backup mechanisms are supported

---

## Implementation

### Programming Language
The project was developed using **C# (.NET)** due to its strong database integration, reliability, and suitability for desktop applications.

### Software Complexity
McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity was calculated for all functions in the project.  
The results indicate a **low to medium complexity level**, ensuring maintainability.

---

## Verification and Validation
White-box testing was applied to:
- User interface functionality
- Button operations
- Database interactions

---

## Conclusion
This project successfully delivers a functional and extensible factory automation system.  
It meets all defined requirements and provides a solid foundation for future improvements.
